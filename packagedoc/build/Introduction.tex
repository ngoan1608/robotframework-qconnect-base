QConnectBaseLibrary is a connection testing library for
\href{https://robotframework.org}{RobotFramework}. Library will be
supported to downloaded from PyPI soon. It provides a mechanism to
handle trace log continously receiving from a connection (such as Raw

It's especially efficient for monitoring the overflood response trace
log from an asynchronous trace systems. It is supporting Python 3.7+ and
RobotFramework 3.2+.
